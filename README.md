## Chinese grammars in HPSG

The *zhong* project implements Chinese grammars in
[HPSG](http://hpsg.stanford.edu/) using the [DELPH-IN](http://delph-in.net)
infrastructure. *zhong* itself is the core grammar of structures
hypothesized to be common to all Chinese languages, and the project
includes grammars for specific Chinese languages that inherit from the
core grammar. The *zhong* core grammar is derived from
[ManGO](http://moin.delph-in.net/MandarinGrammarOnline) Mandarin grammar,
which is based on the [Grammar Matrix](http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/).

## Available Grammars

*zhong* provides the following Chinese grammars:

* [Mandarin](cmn/)
  * [Traditional](cmn/hant/)
  * [Simplified](cmn/hans/)
* [Cantonese](yue/)
